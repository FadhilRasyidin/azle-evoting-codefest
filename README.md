# Lumivote

An IC-blockchain-based Evoting Web Application

## Description

For a national level voting system to be effective, it has to acquire the following criteria:
- Integrity: only eligible voters can participate, and votes cannot be altered or deleted form the system.
- Accessibility and availability: voters can remotely access the system to participate regardless their physical location at any time during the entire electoral period
- Privacy: the voter choice should always remain anonymous during the election and post-election period
- Transparency: the entire system should be auditable by the public, and voters can verify if their votes were casted and tallied
- Affordability: the system has to be affordable for implement and maintain by the government, it should also be less expensive than the traditional paper ballots voting system.

Our 2 main features:
- Voting platform (b2b, non b2g)
- On-demand data provider. The system is that after we get a data request, we can hold a voting/survey program. Or if it's already been done before, we can use it, according to their request.
